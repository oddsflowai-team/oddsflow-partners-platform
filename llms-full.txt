---

## Signal Types

OddsFlow Partners generates three categories of trading signals, each targeting
a different class of market inefficiency.

### HDP Sniper

- **Focus:** Asian handicap line deviations
- **Verified win rate:** 58.3%
- **Method:** Identifies mispricing in Asian handicap markets by comparing
  individual bookmaker lines against the fair-value model. Triggers when a
  bookmaker's handicap line deviates beyond a statistically significant threshold.

### Active Trader

- **Focus:** Coordinated market movements
- **Verified win rate:** 55.1%
- **Method:** Detects coordinated odds movements across multiple bookmakers that
  indicate informed money or sharp action. Signals are generated when movement
  patterns across books exceed expected correlation levels.

### Shield

- **Focus:** Counter-consensus risk identification
- **Verified win rate:** 61.2%
- **Method:** Identifies situations where a bookmaker's position diverges from
  market consensus in a way that suggests elevated risk exposure. Designed for
  defensive risk management rather than directional trading.

---

## Two-Track Solutions

### For Sportsbooks

OddsFlow Partners helps sportsbooks protect margins and improve pricing through:

- **Stale line detection:** Identify lines that have not updated in response to
  market movements, reducing exposure to arbitrage and sharp action.

bookmaker margins from raw odds and produce true implied probabilities. This
provides a neutral benchmark against which individual bookmaker pricing is
measured.

### Ensemble ML Models

Anomaly detection and signal generation are powered by ensemble machine learning
models that combine multiple statistical approaches. These models are trained on
historical odds data and continuously updated as new data arrives.

### Infrastructure

- REST API and WebSocket connections for real-time data delivery
- Sub-200ms response times for API queries
- Sub-100ms delivery for WebSocket streams
- Dashboard access for manual monitoring and analysis

# Odds Monitoring — Real-Time Surveillance & Anomaly Detection

This document describes the odds monitoring capabilities of the OddsFlow Partners
platform, including real-time surveillance, fair-value computation, anomaly
detection, signal generation, and integration options.

---

## What Odds Monitoring Is

Odds monitoring is the continuous collection, normalization, and analysis of
betting odds across multiple bookmakers. Its purpose is to identify when an
individual bookmaker's odds deviate from fair value — whether due to stale
lines, mispricing, or suspicious market movements.

For sportsbooks, odds monitoring protects margins by catching pricing errors
before they are exploited. For feed providers, it provides an objective measure
of feed quality and accuracy.

---

## Why It Matters

Bookmaker odds are set independently and updated at different speeds. At any
given moment, some bookmakers will be mispriced relative to the true market.
These mispricings create risk:

- **For sportsbooks:** Stale or mispriced lines attract sharp bettors and
  arbitrageurs, eroding margins.
- **For feed providers:** Inaccurate or delayed feeds reduce client confidence
  and create downstream pricing errors.
- **For the market:** Undetected anomalies can indicate suspicious activity
  that warrants investigation.

Continuous monitoring surfaces these issues in real time, before they cause
material financial impact.

---

## How OddsFlow Monitors Odds

OddsFlow Partners ingests odds from 50+ global bookmakers across multiple
sports and market types. The monitoring pipeline operates as follows:

1. **Ingestion** — Raw odds are collected from bookmaker APIs and partner data
   connections. Data arrives continuously at sub-second intervals.
2. **Normalization** — Odds are converted to a common format (decimal odds and
   implied probabilities) and aligned by event, market type, and selection.
3. **Fair-value computation** — The Shin de-vig methodology strips bookmaker
   margins to compute true implied probabilities for each selection.
4. **Comparison** — Each bookmaker's odds are compared against fair value.
   Deviations are measured in standard deviations and implied probability gaps.
5. **Anomaly detection** — Statistical models evaluate whether deviations are
   within normal range or represent actionable anomalies.
6. **Signal generation** — Anomalies that meet predefined thresholds are
   classified by type, severity, and confidence.
7. **Delivery** — Signals and data are delivered via REST API, WebSocket
   streams, and the monitoring dashboard.

---

## Fair-Value Engine

### Shin De-Vig Methodology

The platform uses the Shin model to remove bookmaker overround (vig) from raw
odds. The Shin method accounts for the fact that bookmaker margins are not
applied uniformly across all outcomes — favorites carry less margin than
longshots. This produces more accurate implied probabilities than simpler
methods such as proportional margin removal.

The fair-value engine:

- Aggregates odds from all monitored bookmakers for each event and market
- Applies the Shin de-vig model to compute margin-free implied probabilities
- Weights bookmaker inputs based on historical accuracy and sharpness
- Updates fair values continuously as new odds data arrives
- Provides a neutral benchmark for measuring individual book pricing

The Shin model was developed specifically to address the favorite-longshot bias
in bookmaker pricing, making it more suitable for fair-value estimation in
sports betting markets than proportional de-vig approaches.

---

## Anomaly Detection

The anomaly detection layer sits on top of the fair-value engine. It uses
statistical models to determine whether a bookmaker's odds deviate from fair
value by more than expected.

### Stale Lines

A bookmaker's odds have not updated in response to market movements. The
platform tracks each bookmaker's last price update relative to fair-value
movement and flags lines that fail to respond within an expected window. Stale
lines are a primary target for arbitrage bettors and represent direct margin
erosion.

### Mispricing

A bookmaker's odds differ from fair value beyond normal margin variation.
Statistical comparison of implied probabilities against the Shin-derived fair
value flags deviations that exceed configurable thresholds.

### Suspicious Movements

Odds move in patterns inconsistent with normal market behavior — sudden large
movements at a single bookmaker, movements preceding public information, or
coordinated shifts across a small subset of books that diverge from the broader
market. Time-series analysis across all monitored bookmakers flags deviations
outside normal statistical bounds.

---

## Signal Types

When anomalies are detected, they are classified into one of three signal types.

### HDP Sniper

- **Target:** Asian handicap line deviations
- **Verified win rate:** 58.3%
- **Description:** Identifies mispricing in Asian handicap markets by comparing
  individual bookmaker lines against the Shin-derived fair value. Asian handicap
  markets are particularly susceptible to stale lines due to the granularity of
  half-goal and quarter-goal adjustments.

### Active Trader

- **Target:** Coordinated market movements
- **Verified win rate:** 55.1%
- **Description:** Detects coordinated odds movements across multiple bookmakers
  that indicate informed money entering the market. Signals are generated when
  cross-bookmaker correlation patterns exceed expected levels.

### Shield

- **Target:** Counter-consensus risk positions
- **Verified win rate:** 61.2%
- **Description:** Identifies situations where a bookmaker's position diverges
  materially from market consensus, indicating elevated risk exposure. Designed
  for defensive risk management — alerting sportsbooks to concentrated liability
  positions.

---

## Alert System

Each alert includes:

- **Signal type** — HDP Sniper, Active Trader, or Shield
- **Severity score** — Numeric rating based on deviation magnitude
- **Confidence interval** — Statistical confidence in the anomaly detection
- **Affected bookmaker(s)** — Which bookmaker(s) show the anomaly
- **Event details** — Sport, league, teams, market type, and kickoff time
- **Fair-value context** — Current fair value, bookmaker odds, and deviation size
- **Timestamp** — When the anomaly was detected

Severity scoring accounts for deviation magnitude, anomaly duration, number of
affected bookmakers, historical frequency, and estimated financial exposure.

### Delivery Channels

- **WebSocket** — Real-time push delivery, sub-100ms latency
- **REST API** — Polling-based access, sub-200ms response time
- **Dashboard** — Visual interface with filtering, sorting, and drill-down

# Sportsbook Solutions — Risk Management & Odds Quality

> OddsFlow Partners provides risk intelligence and odds quality infrastructure for sportsbooks. We help trading desks detect mispriced markets, manage liability exposure, and automate risk workflows using real-time data from 50+ bookmakers.

---

## The Problem

Sportsbooks face persistent operational challenges that directly impact margins:

### Stale Odds Create Arbitrage Windows

When odds lag behind market movements — even by seconds — sophisticated bettors exploit the gap. Arbitrage and value-betting syndicates continuously scan for stale lines across books. A single slow market update can open a window that costs thousands before it closes.

### Liability Exposure from Mispriced Markets

Mispriced odds attract disproportionate action on one side of a market. Without independent benchmarks, traders may not recognize a pricing error until the liability is already concentrated. Correlated mispricings across related markets (e.g., match winner and set handicap in tennis) compound the exposure.

### Manual Risk Management Does Not Scale

Human traders cannot monitor thousands of live markets simultaneously. Manual processes introduce latency in detection and response. As market coverage grows — more sports, more leagues, more bet types — the gap between what needs monitoring and what gets monitored widens.

---

## Core Solutions

### 1. Anomaly Detection

OddsFlow Partners compares your odds against fair-value benchmarks derived from 50+ bookmakers using the Shin de-vig methodology. This produces market-consensus fair odds that account for bookmaker margins and known biases.

**How it works:**

- **Real-time deviation alerts.** When your odds diverge from fair value beyond a configurable threshold, an alert fires. Alerts include the magnitude of deviation, the direction, and which bookmakers are aligned with the consensus.
- **Severity scoring.** Each anomaly is scored on a multi-factor scale: size of deviation, market liquidity, time to event, and historical pattern. A 2% deviation on an NFL moneyline 30 minutes before kickoff is treated differently than a 2% deviation on a lower-tier league three days out.
- **Confidence intervals.** Fair-value estimates include confidence bands so traders can distinguish between a clear mispricing and a market where consensus is fragmented.
- **Historical anomaly pattern analysis.** OddsFlow tracks anomaly patterns over time — by sport, league, market type, and time-of-day — to identify systematic issues in your pricing pipeline. Recurring anomalies on specific market types may indicate a feed issue or model gap rather than a one-off error.

### 2. Risk Intelligence

Anomaly detection tells you when a single market is off. Risk intelligence tells you what is happening across your book.

- **Correlated market movement analysis.** When odds shift on a football match winner market, OddsFlow checks whether your related markets — Asian handicap, totals, first-half lines — have moved accordingly. Uncorrelated movement across related markets signals exposure.
- **Bettor behavior correlation.** Aggregate betting patterns are correlated with market movements. When sharp-money flow indicators align with odds movement at other books but your lines have not moved, that is a signal.
- **Odds topology mapping.** OddsFlow maps the structure of your odds across markets to identify clusters of correlated risk. If liability is building on one side of multiple related markets, the system flags the aggregate exposure.
- **Sharp-money flow indicators.** By tracking which bookmakers move first and how the market follows, OddsFlow identifies sharp-driven movement and distinguishes it from recreational volume.
- **Customizable risk threshold alerts.** Set thresholds by sport, league, market type, liability amount, or any combination. Alerts route to the right trader or team based on your escalation rules.

### 3. Market Efficiency Scoring

Every market in your book receives a real-time efficiency score that quantifies how closely your odds align with the broader market consensus.

- **Per-market efficiency scores.** Scores are updated continuously as new data arrives. A score of 100 means your odds are at consensus; lower scores indicate divergence.
- **Trend analysis.** Track efficiency over time to measure the impact of pricing changes, feed upgrades, or new model deployments. Weekly and monthly rollups show whether your book is getting sharper or drifting.
- **Competitive positioning.** See where your odds sit relative to market consensus — and relative to specific competitor segments. Understand whether you are consistently offering value on certain market types.

---

## Integration Models

OddsFlow Partners offers three integration paths, each designed for a different stage of adoption.

### API Overlay

The fastest path to production. Connect your existing odds feed and receive enriched data back.

- **Sub-100ms response time.** Designed for live trading workflows where latency matters.
- **REST and WebSocket endpoints.** Use REST for on-demand queries and WebSocket for streaming alerts and score updates.
- **Live in days, not months.** Minimal integration effort. Send us your odds; we return anomaly scores, efficiency ratings, and risk signals.

### White-Label Platform

For sportsbooks that want a fully branded risk management interface for their trading teams.

- **Full branding.** Your logo, your colors, your domain. Traders see your platform, powered by OddsFlow data.
- **SSO and RBAC.** Single sign-on integration with your identity provider. Role-based access control lets you define permissions by team, sport, or market tier.

# Feed Provider Solutions — Quality Auditing & Certification

> OddsFlow Partners provides independent quality auditing and certification for odds feed providers. We help feed companies prove data quality with transparent benchmarks, identify issues before clients do, and differentiate on measurable accuracy and freshness.

---

## The Problem

Odds feed providers face challenges that are difficult to solve internally:

### Quality Complaints Without Independent Benchmarks

When a sportsbook client says your odds are "off," how do you evaluate the claim? Without an independent reference point, quality disputes become subjective. Providers end up in back-and-forth investigations that consume engineering time and strain client relationships. An external benchmark turns subjective complaints into objective, measurable conversations.

### Latency and Freshness Issues Erode Client Margins

Odds data that arrives even slightly late costs your clients money. Stale prices create arbitrage windows that sharp bettors exploit before the sportsbook can react. Clients may not always tell you about latency issues — they simply lose margin and eventually look for an alternative feed. Continuous freshness measurement catches degradation before it becomes a retention problem.

### Coverage Gaps Are Hard to Identify at Scale

When you cover thousands of events across dozens of sports, missing markets are easy to overlook. A dropped league, a missing bet type, or inconsistent coverage of in-play markets may not trigger an internal alert but will be noticed by clients comparing your feed to competitors. Systematic coverage auditing against the broader market reveals gaps that internal monitoring misses.

---

## Core Solutions

### 1. Feed Quality Scoring

Every update in your feed receives an accuracy and freshness score. These scores roll up from individual updates to markets, events, sports, and your entire portfolio.

**How it works:**

- **Per-update accuracy and freshness scores.** Each odds update is compared against fair-value benchmarks at the moment it arrives. Accuracy measures how close the update is to consensus. Freshness measures how quickly it arrived relative to market movers.
- **Hierarchical rollups.** Scores aggregate from the update level to the market level, then to the event, sport, and portfolio level. This lets you see both the big picture and drill down to specific problem areas.
- **Trend analysis with configurable alerting.** Track quality scores over time. Set alerts for when a sport or market type drops below a threshold, or when a trend line indicates gradual degradation. Catch issues during development — not after client complaints.

### 2. Fair-Odds Benchmarking

OddsFlow Partners constructs consensus fair odds from 50+ bookmakers using the Shin de-vig methodology. These benchmarks serve as the independent reference point for all quality measurements.

- **Consensus fair odds from 50+ bookmakers.** The Shin model removes bookmaker margins to produce true probability estimates. Aggregating across 50+ sources produces a robust consensus that is resistant to any single bookmaker's bias.
- **Deviation heatmaps.** Visualize where your feed diverges from fair value. Heatmaps organized by sport, league, market type, and time show patterns at a glance. A cluster of deviations on a specific league's in-play totals, for example, points to a targeted issue.
- **Latency benchmarking vs. market movers.** OddsFlow measures how quickly your feed reflects market movements initiated by sharp bookmakers. This latency benchmark is expressed in milliseconds and compared against the competitive landscape, so you know where you stand.

### 3. Anomaly Detection

Statistical anomaly detection identifies issues that quality scoring alone may miss — sudden breaks, pipeline failures, and data corruption.

- **Statistical anomaly detection with severity tiers.** Anomalies are classified by severity: informational, warning, and critical. Severity is determined by the magnitude of the deviation, the importance of the market, and the duration of the issue.
- **Pipeline health monitoring.** Beyond individual odds values, OddsFlow monitors the health of your data pipeline: update frequency, gap detection, and consistency checks. A sudden drop in update volume for a sport can indicate a pipeline issue before it manifests as incorrect odds.
- **Root cause classification.** Detected anomalies are tagged with probable root causes: feed delay, model error, missing data, stale cache, or upstream provider issue. This accelerates your team's investigation and resolution process.

---

## Third-Party Quality Certification

Independent quality certification gives feed providers a credible way to demonstrate data quality to current and prospective clients.

### Certified Quality Reports

Monthly and quarterly PDF reports that summarize your feed's quality performance against OddsFlow benchmarks.

- Accuracy, freshness, coverage, and consistency scores with historical trends.
- Comparison against anonymized industry percentiles so clients can see relative performance.
- Detailed breakdowns by sport, league, and market type.
- Designed to be shared directly with clients and prospects as a trust-building tool.

### Live Quality Badge

A real-time quality score widget that you can embed on your website or client portal.

- Displays your current quality score, updated continuously.
- Clients and prospects can see live performance without requesting a report.
- Badge design is configurable to match your branding.
- Links to a detailed quality dashboard for users who want to drill deeper.

### Client-Facing Dashboards

Interactive dashboards that your clients can access to view the quality of the feed they receive.

- Clients see accuracy, freshness, and coverage scores for the sports and markets they subscribe to.
- Historical trend views let clients verify that quality is stable or improving.
- Reduces inbound support queries about data quality by providing self-service transparency.
- Access is managed through your existing client portal or provided as a standalone link.

---

## Sample Certification Metrics

The following are example metrics from a certified quality report:

| Metric           | Score   | Description                                                  |
|------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**     | 94.2%   | Percentage of odds updates within acceptable deviation of fair-value consensus |
| **Freshness**    | A+      | Odds update latency relative to market-moving bookmakers     |
| **Coverage**     | 98.7%   | Percentage of available markets covered vs. the full market universe |
| **Anomaly Rate** | 0.3%    | Percentage of updates flagged as statistical anomalies       |
| **Consistency**  | 97.1%   | Stability of odds updates — absence of erratic jumps or gaps |

These scores are calculated against OddsFlow benchmarks derived from 50+ bookmakers using Shin de-vig methodology. Scoring criteria and methodology are documented and available for client review.

---

# Agentic AI Infrastructure for Sports Betting

## OddsFlow Partners — Building the Agent Layer for Sports Betting

OddsFlow Partners is building the foundational infrastructure that enables autonomous AI agents to operate across the sports betting ecosystem. Our vision is a future where sportsbooks, feed providers, and end users each deploy intelligent agents that communicate, verify, and transact — machine to machine — with minimal human intervention.

---

## Vision

The sports betting industry generates enormous volumes of real-time data: odds movements, line changes, injury reports, settlement results, and liability exposures. Today, humans monitor dashboards and react to alerts. Tomorrow, purpose-built AI agents will handle continuous monitoring, autonomous data verification, intelligent trading decisions, and cross-platform communication on behalf of their operators.

OddsFlow Partners provides the infrastructure to make this transition possible:

- **Custom AI Agents** tailored to each platform's unique needs
- **Machine-to-Machine Communication** through an open, standardized protocol
- **Autonomous Data Verification** where agents cross-reference multiple sources before reporting
- **Intelligent Trading Infrastructure** that surfaces opportunities and manages risk without human bottlenecks

---

## Three Pillars

### 1. Custom Agent Development

We design and deploy AI agents tailored to your platform. Whether you are a sportsbook, a data feed provider, or a trading desk, we build agents that integrate with your existing systems and operate autonomously within the boundaries you define.

- **Six agent types** available: Odds Monitoring, Data Verification, Risk Assessment, Market Analysis, Trading Assistant, and Compliance
- **Proof of Concept delivered in 4 weeks** — a working agent connected to your environment, demonstrating core functionality
- **Production deployment in 8 weeks** — fully tested, monitored, and ready for live operation
- Agents are built on OddsFlow infrastructure but operate within your environment, under your control

Learn more: [Custom Agent Development](./custom-agents.md)

### 2. Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol

Our open protocol defines how agents communicate across organizational boundaries. A sportsbook's risk agent can query a feed provider's data agent. A user's personal agent can request verified odds from multiple sportsbook agents simultaneously. The protocol ensures structured, verifiable, auditable exchanges.

- **Open protocol** — published specification, reference implementations, community governance
- **Structured data exchange** with standardized message formats for odds, markets, signals, and settlements
- **Mutual verification** — agents independently verify each other's claims against fair-value benchmarks
- **Reputation-based trust** — every interaction is scored, and agents with higher reputation are prioritized in the network

Learn more: [Agent-to-Agent Protocol](./agent-protocol.md)

### 3. Agent Reputation Network

Every agent on the OddsFlow network accumulates a cryptographic track record. Accuracy, latency, uptime, and consistency are continuously measured and scored. This reputation is portable and verifiable — third-party agents can query it before deciding whether to trust a counterpart.

- **Cryptographic track records** — immutable logs of every claim, verification, and interaction
- **Dynamic scoring from 0 to 100** — updated in real time based on agent performance across accuracy, latency, uptime, and consistency
- **Open protocol for third-party agents** — any agent, whether built by OddsFlow or independently, can participate in the Reputation Network and earn trust through performance
- Higher-reputation agents receive priority routing, better data access, and preferential treatment in trading negotiations

---

## Deployment Timeline

OddsFlow follows a structured deployment process to move from initial discovery to a live, continuously learning agent:

| Phase | Timeline | Activities |
|---|---|---|
| **Discovery** | Week 1 | Map your data sources, workflows, and integration points. Define agent objectives and success criteria. |
| **Agent Design** | Week 2 | Select agent types, design communication flows, define verification rules and escalation policies. |
| **Integration & Testing** | Weeks 3-4 | Connect agents to your platform, run parallel testing against live data, validate accuracy and latency. |
| **Continuous Learning** | Ongoing | Agents improve over time. Performance is monitored, models are retrained, and new capabilities are added based on observed patterns. |

This timeline applies to a single-agent Proof of Concept. Multi-agent deployments and enterprise integrations follow an extended 8-week timeline with additional testing and compliance review.

---

## Use Cases for Sportsbooks

Sportsbooks operate in a high-frequency, high-stakes environment where seconds matter. OddsFlow agents are designed to operate at machine speed, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

- **Deploy 24/7 monitoring agents** that scan every line across every market, flagging anomalies, stale lines, and arbitrage exposures before they are exploited
- **Enable end-user agents** — allow your customers to deploy personal agents that interact with your platform through the A2A Protocol, creating a differentiated, agent-native user experience
- **Automate risk assessment** with agents that continuously evaluate liability concentrations, correlated exposures, and sharp-money flow, escalating to human traders only when severity thresholds are breached
- **Become an agent-native platform** — the first sportsbook to offer full agent compatibility gains a structural advantage as autonomous betting becomes mainstream

---

## Use Cases for Feed Providers

Feed providers are the backbone of the sports betting data ecosystem. OddsFlow agents make feeds smarter, more reliable, and ready for the agentic future.

- **Agent-ready feeds** — structure your data output so that downstream agents can consume, parse, and act on it autonomously without custom integration work
- **Verification agents** — deploy agents that continuously audit your own feed accuracy against independent benchmarks, catching errors before your clients do
- **Autonomous data consumption** — enable institutional clients to connect their agents directly to your feed, reducing support overhead and accelerating onboarding
- **Build trust via the Reputation Network** — your feed agents accumulate verified track records that prospective clients can audit before signing a contract

---

## SportBot: The First Autonomous Sports Betting Agent

SportBot is our flagship showcase — the first autonomous sports betting agent built on OddsFlow infrastructure. It demonstrates what becomes possible when custom agents, the A2A Protocol, and the Reputation Network work together.

SportBot autonomously:

- Monitors odds across multiple sportsbooks in real time
- Cross-verifies data through the A2A Protocol before acting
- Identifies value opportunities using fair-value benchmarks
- Presents verified intelligence to its operator with full audit trails
- Accumulates reputation on the Agent Reputation Network

SportBot is not a product for sale — it is a living demonstration of the OddsFlow agentic AI infrastructure in action. It proves the architecture works and shows partners what their own custom agents can achieve.

# Custom Agent Development

## Purpose-Built AI Agents for Sports Betting Platforms

OddsFlow Partners designs, builds, and deploys custom AI agents tailored to the specific needs of sportsbooks, feed providers, and trading operations. Each agent is purpose-built for its role, integrated with your existing infrastructure, and connected to the OddsFlow Agent Network for cross-platform communication and verification.

---

## Six Agent Types

### 1. Odds Monitoring Agent

The Odds Monitoring Agent operates 24/7, continuously scanning your lines and comparing them against fair-value benchmarks derived from multiple data sources.

- Scans every active market across all sports on a sub-second cycle
- Compares each line against dynamically calculated fair-value benchmarks
- Flags anomalies: stale lines, outlier prices, sudden movements without corresponding market triggers
- Generates prioritized alerts with severity scores so your trading team focuses on what matters most
- Maintains a historical log of every flag and resolution for audit and model improvement

### 2. Data Verification Agent

The Data Verification Agent cross-references incoming data from multiple sources in real time, detecting discrepancies before they propagate through your platform.

- Ingests data from your primary feed and one or more secondary sources simultaneously
- Compares fields at the event level: scores, statuses, statistics, timestamps, and settlement triggers
- Detects discrepancies within milliseconds and classifies them by type and severity
- Escalates confirmed conflicts to your operations team with full context and recommended resolution
- Tracks verification accuracy over time, building a reliability profile for each data source

### 3. Risk Assessment Agent

The Risk Assessment Agent continuously evaluates your book's exposure, identifying liability concentrations and correlated risks before they become material.

- Monitors liability concentrations across markets, sports, and event clusters in real time
- Detects correlated event exposure — groups of bets that move together if a single outcome changes
- Tracks sharp-money flow by identifying betting patterns associated with informed bettors
- Assigns severity scores (Low, Medium, High, Critical) based on configurable thresholds
- Provides continuous risk surface reporting that updates with every new bet or line movement

### 4. Market Analysis Agent

The Market Analysis Agent provides contextual intelligence about market structure, movement patterns, and sentiment across the sports betting landscape.

- Analyzes market structure: where liquidity sits, how lines are distributed, where consensus forms
- Tracks movement patterns: how lines migrate over time, which books lead and which follow
- Monitors sentiment signals from public betting data, media, and social channels
- Provides contextual intelligence: connects market movements to real-world events like injuries, weather, and roster changes
- Delivers structured reports and real-time feeds that your trading team or downstream agents can consume

### 5. Trading Assistant Agent

The Trading Assistant Agent acts as a co-pilot for your human traders, surfacing the highest-priority opportunities and risks while filtering out noise.

- Pre-filters the universe of active markets to surface only actionable opportunities and risks
- Ranks opportunities by expected value, confidence, and time sensitivity
- Presents concise briefs with supporting evidence — the data behind the recommendation
- Learns trader preferences over time, adapting its filtering and ranking to match your team's style
- Integrates with your trading interface to deliver intelligence in context, not in a separate dashboard

### 6. Compliance Agent

The Compliance Agent monitors activity across your platform for suspicious patterns, regulatory compliance, and audit readiness.

- Monitors betting activity for suspicious patterns: unusual volumes, correlated accounts, timing anomalies
- Flags potential regulatory compliance issues based on jurisdiction-specific rules
- Generates audit-ready reports with full traceability — every flag includes the data, the rule, and the reasoning
- Adapts to regulatory changes as new rules are published and configured
- Maintains a complete, tamper-evident log of all compliance events and dispositions

**Your Platform** connects to the **OddsFlow Agent Layer** through standard APIs. Your custom agents operate within this layer, communicating internally with your systems and externally with other agents through the A2A Protocol. **External Agents** — whether operated by partners, feed providers, or end users — interact with your agents through the same protocol, with trust managed by the Reputation Network.

Key integration points:

- **Inbound data:** Your platform pushes data to agents via webhooks, streaming APIs, or message queues
- **Outbound actions:** Agents push alerts, recommendations, and reports back to your platform through the same channels
- **External communication:** Agents communicate with external agents through the A2A Protocol gateway, with all interactions logged and scored
- **Monitoring:** All agent activity is logged, metered, and available through a management dashboard

# Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol for Sports Betting

## Agents That Verify Before They Report

The OddsFlow A2A Protocol is an open communication standard that enables AI agents across the sports betting ecosystem to exchange data, verify claims, and build trust — machine to machine. Personal agents query sportsbook agents. Sportsbook agents cross-verify through feed provider agents. Every interaction is scored, logged, and traceable.

The result: verified intelligence, not raw data.

---

## Vision

Today, sports betting data flows through pipelines — static, unverified, and consumed without question. Tomorrow, intelligent agents will query, negotiate, and verify data on behalf of their operators before presenting conclusions.

The A2A Protocol makes this possible by defining:

- **How agents discover each other** across organizational boundaries
- **How agents exchange structured data** — odds, markets, signals, settlements
- **How agents verify each other's claims** against independent benchmarks
- **How agents build and query trust** through the Reputation Network

The protocol is open, published, and governed by the community. Any agent — whether built by OddsFlow, a sportsbook, a feed provider, or an independent developer — can participate.

---

## Communication Flow

Here is how a typical verification flow works through the A2A Protocol:

```
┌──────────────┐    Query     ┌───────────────────┐    Verify    ┌──────────────────┐
│              │─────────────►│                   │─────────────►│                  │
│  User's      │              │  Sportsbook's     │              │  OddsFlow        │
│  Agent       │◄─────────────│  Agent            │◄─────────────│  Verification    │
│              │   Verified   │                   │  Confirmed   │  Network         │
└──────────────┘  Intelligence└───────────────────┘   Data       └──────────────────┘
```

**Step by step:**

1. A **User's Agent** sends a structured query to a **Sportsbook's Agent** — for example, requesting current odds on a specific market
2. The **Sportsbook's Agent** retrieves the data from its platform and simultaneously requests **cross-verification from OddsFlow**
3. **OddsFlow's verification agents** compare the sportsbook's data against multiple independent sources and fair-value benchmarks
4. The **Sportsbook's Agent** receives the verification result and packages a response that includes both the data and the verification status
5. The **User's Agent** receives **verified intelligence** — not just odds, but odds confirmed against independent benchmarks, with a trust score attached

Every step is logged with cryptographic timestamps. Every agent involved accumulates reputation based on accuracy, latency, and reliability.

---

## Protocol Capabilities

### 1. Structured Data Exchange

The A2A Protocol defines standardized message formats for every common interaction in sports betting:

- **Odds queries:** Request current, historical, or projected odds for specific events, markets, and selections
- **Market data:** Exchange market structure information including liquidity, line distribution, and consensus pricing
- **Trading signals:** Share actionable intelligence with confidence scores, supporting evidence, and time sensitivity
- **Settlement data:** Exchange event results, settlement triggers, and final outcomes with full provenance
- **Status messages:** Communicate agent availability, capability declarations, and health signals

All messages follow a versioned schema. Agents declare which versions they support, and the protocol handles negotiation and backward compatibility.

### 2. Mutual Verification

The protocol's core innovation is built-in mutual verification. Agents do not simply accept data at face value — they verify before they report.

- Agents independently verify each other's data against fair-value benchmarks maintained by the OddsFlow network
- Verification is automatic and occurs within the protocol handshake — no additional integration required
- Verification results are attached to every response, including confidence level and the sources consulted
- Discrepancies are flagged, classified, and escalated according to configurable severity thresholds
- Agents that consistently provide verified-accurate data earn higher reputation scores

### 3. Reputation-Based Trust

Every interaction on the A2A Protocol is scored. Agents accumulate reputation over time, and this reputation directly influences how the network treats them.

- Every data exchange, verification, and response is scored for accuracy, latency, and reliability
- Reputation scores range from 0 to 100 and update dynamically with each interaction
- Higher-reputation agents are prioritized in query routing — their responses are weighted more heavily
- New agents start with a provisional score and build reputation through verified interactions
- Reputation is portable and queryable — any agent can check another agent's score before engaging

### 4. Full Audit Trail

The protocol maintains a complete, cryptographically secured record of every interaction.

- **Cryptographic timestamps** on every message, verification, and response
- **Complete traceability** — any data point can be traced back through every agent that touched it
- **Immutable logs** that cannot be altered after the fact
- **Audit-ready exports** in standard formats for regulatory compliance and dispute resolution
- **Provenance chains** that show exactly where data originated and how it was verified

---

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Personal Agent Queries Multiple Sportsbooks

A bettor's personal agent wants to find the best odds on an upcoming NBA game.

1. The agent sends parallel queries to sportsbook agents at five different books via the A2A Protocol
2. Each sportsbook agent responds with its current odds and the verification status from OddsFlow
3. The personal agent cross-verifies all five responses against each other and against the OddsFlow fair-value benchmark
4. The agent presents a curated comparison to its user: verified odds from each book, ranked by value, with confidence scores and any flagged discrepancies
5. All interactions are logged. The sportsbook agents that responded fastest with the most accurate data earn reputation points.

### Scenario 2: Feed Broadcast Verification

A data feed provider broadcasts a score update for a live match.

1. The feed provider's agent broadcasts the update to all subscribed agents via the A2A Protocol
2. Each receiving agent automatically triggers a verification request to OddsFlow and at least one independent source
3. If the broadcast matches independent verification, it is accepted and marked as verified
4. If a discrepancy is detected, receiving agents flag the conflict, pause dependent actions, and request resolution
5. The feed provider's reputation score updates based on the accuracy of its broadcast. Consistently accurate feeds earn higher trust, reducing verification latency over time.

### Scenario 3: Trading Negotiation Between Institutional Agents

Two institutional trading agents want to exchange market intelligence.

1. Agent A queries Agent B's reputation on the OddsFlow Reputation Network before initiating contact
2. Satisfied with the score, Agent A sends a structured intelligence-sharing request via the A2A Protocol
3. Agent B evaluates Agent A's reputation in return, confirming mutual trust
4. The agents exchange market analysis with full provenance — every claim backed by verifiable data and sources
5. Both agents score the interaction. Accurate, timely intelligence earns reputation. Misleading or stale data reduces it.

---

## Open Standard

The A2A Protocol is designed to be an open standard for the sports betting industry, not a proprietary lock-in.

- **Published specification** — the full protocol spec is publicly available and versioned
- **Reference implementation** — OddsFlow provides open-source reference implementations in common languages to accelerate adoption
- **Community governance** — protocol changes are proposed, discussed, and ratified through a transparent governance process
- **No vendor lock-in** — any agent can implement the protocol independently, without using OddsFlow infrastructure
- **Extensibility** — the protocol supports custom message types and extensions for domain-specific use cases

We believe the agent ecosystem grows faster when the communication layer is open. OddsFlow's business is building agents and infrastructure, not gatekeeping the protocol.

---

## Integration with the Agent Reputation Network

The A2A Protocol and the Agent Reputation Network are deeply integrated:

- **Every A2A interaction updates reputation** — there is no separate reputation system; trust is built through protocol participation
- **Reputation gates are configurable** — agents can set minimum reputation thresholds for accepting queries or sharing data
- **Reputation is queryable via the protocol** — agents can check any other agent's score as a standard protocol operation
- **Third-party agents earn reputation equally** — agents built outside OddsFlow participate in the same Reputation Network on equal terms
- **Reputation decay** — agents that go inactive see their scores gradually decay, ensuring the network reflects current performance

---

## Getting Started with the A2A Protocol

1. **Review the specification** — available at [www.oddsflow-partners.com](https://www.oddsflow-partners.com)
2. **Deploy your first agent** — use our [Custom Agent Development](./custom-agents.md) service or build your own using the reference implementation
3. **Connect to the network** — register your agent with the OddsFlow Reputation Network and begin building trust
4. **Exchange data** — start querying and responding to other agents on the network

# Agent Reputation Network

## The Trust Layer for AI Agents in Sports Betting

As AI agents proliferate across the sports betting ecosystem, a critical question
emerges: which agents can you trust? The Agent Reputation Network is OddsFlow
Partners' answer — a transparent, quantitative framework that distinguishes
trustworthy agents from unreliable ones, protects platforms from bad actors, and
gives users verifiable confidence in the tools they rely on.

---

## Why Reputation Matters

### Platform Protection

Platforms integrating third-party agents need assurance that those agents will not
degrade service quality, expose users to reckless strategies, or introduce
manipulative signals. The Reputation Network enables platforms to set minimum
score thresholds, automatically blocking low-reputation agents before they reach
end users.

### User Confidence

Users deserve verifiable track records — not marketing claims. Every agent in the
network carries a public reputation score backed by auditable prediction history,
accuracy metrics, and peer validation. Users can compare agents side-by-side and
make informed decisions about which ones to trust with their capital.

### Market Integrity

Bad actors — agents that spoof signals, front-run markets, or publish fabricated
records — threaten the entire ecosystem. The Reputation Network deters misconduct
by making every prediction attributable and every outcome verifiable. Agents that
attempt manipulation see their scores collapse and their access revoked.

---

## Five Dimensions of Reputation

Each agent's reputation score is a weighted composite of five independently
measured dimensions.

### 1. Accuracy — 30% Weight

How closely an agent's outputs match verified outcomes. This is the most heavily
weighted dimension because, ultimately, predictive performance is what matters.
Accuracy is measured across all prediction types (moneyline, spread, totals) using
Brier scores, calibration curves, and raw hit rates over rolling windows.

### 2. Consistency — 25% Weight

Stability of performance over time. An agent that posts a 60% hit rate one month
and 40% the next is less trustworthy than one that sustains 54% month after month.
Consistency is measured via standard deviation of rolling accuracy, drawdown
frequency, and streak analysis.

### 3. Transparency — 20% Weight

Methodology disclosure and audit trail quality. Agents earn transparency points by
publishing their modeling approach, providing confidence intervals alongside
predictions, disclosing data sources, and maintaining a complete, tamper-evident
audit trail of every signal they have ever issued.

### 4. Response Quality — 15% Weight

Operational reliability matters. This dimension captures API latency (p50, p95,
p99), uptime percentage, data completeness (no missing fields), and adherence to
the A2A protocol specification. An agent that delivers brilliant predictions but
goes offline during peak hours is penalized accordingly.

### 5. Peer Validation — 10% Weight

Endorsements and cross-verification from other agents in the network. When
multiple independent agents converge on the same signal, confidence increases.
Peer validation also includes explicit endorsements — agents can stake a portion of
their own reputation to vouch for another agent's reliability.

---

## Reputation Tiers

Agents progress through three tiers based on their composite score (0–100 scale).

### Verified — Score 50 to 74

- Identity verified through registration process
- Basic API access to OddsFlow data feeds
- Standard rate limits (1,000 requests/hour)
- Predictions tracked and scored publicly
- Eligible for Trusted tier after 30 days of sustained performance

### Trusted — Score 75 to 89

- Priority weighting in ensemble models
- Elevated rate limits (10,000 requests/hour)
- Access to partner integrations and co-branded features
- Eligible for premium data feeds
- Badge displayed on agent profile and leaderboard

### Elite — Score 90 and Above

- Highest ensemble weighting across all OddsFlow models
- Unlimited API rate limits
- Access to premium endpoints (early signals, raw model outputs)
- Featured in the OddsFlow agent showcase
- Invited to contribute to network governance decisions
- Priority support channel with the OddsFlow engineering team

## For Agent Developers

Building an agent? Here is how to join the Reputation Network.

1. **Register** your agent at the OddsFlow Partners developer portal. Provide a
   description, methodology summary, and contact information.
2. **Submit predictions** through the standardized A2A protocol. Every prediction
   is timestamped, hashed, and stored immutably for later verification.
3. **Access analytics** through the developer dashboard. Monitor your score across
   all five dimensions, identify areas for improvement, and benchmark against
   peers.
4. **Progress through tiers** by sustaining strong performance. There are no
   shortcuts — reputation is earned through verified outcomes over time.

The developer documentation includes SDKs for Python and TypeScript, example
agents, and a sandbox environment for testing before going live.

---

## For Platforms

Integrating the Reputation Network into your platform takes minutes, not months.

- **Set thresholds**: Define the minimum reputation score required for agents to
  operate on your platform. Different thresholds can apply to different actions
  (e.g., viewing data vs. placing bets).
- **Query scores via API**: A single REST endpoint returns the current composite

# SportBot — Autonomous Sports Betting Agent

## The First End-to-End Autonomous Sports Betting Agent

SportBot is the first fully autonomous sports betting agent built on OddsFlow
infrastructure. From pre-match research to bet placement to post-match review,
SportBot handles the entire workflow — analyzing markets, identifying value,
executing within user-defined risk parameters, and publishing a transparent track
record for anyone to verify.

Website: [clawsportbot.io](https://clawsportbot.io)

---

## Six Core Capabilities

### 1. Pre-match Analysis

SportBot autonomously analyzes upcoming events using OddsFlow fair-value models,
historical performance data, team form indicators, injury reports, and market
sentiment. Before any market opens, SportBot has already built a probabilistic
model of likely outcomes and identified where the value opportunities are most
likely to appear.

### 2. Live Stats Monitoring

Once a match begins, SportBot shifts into real-time mode. It monitors in-play
statistics — possession, shots, expected goals, momentum shifts — alongside
real-time market movements across sportsbooks. This allows SportBot to detect
live value that pre-match models could not anticipate, such as a key player
injury mid-match or a tactical substitution that changes the game state.

### 3. Value Odds Finding

SportBot cross-references odds from multiple sportsbooks against OddsFlow
fair-value probabilities to identify discrepancies. Each opportunity is assigned
a confidence score based on the magnitude of the discrepancy, the number of
books showing the same edge, and the historical reliability of the underlying
signal. Only opportunities that exceed configurable confidence thresholds are
surfaced.

### 4. Authorized Bet Placement

With explicit user authorization, SportBot can execute bets autonomously — but
always within user-defined risk parameters. Users configure stake limits (per bet
and daily aggregate), sport restrictions, minimum confidence thresholds, and
bankroll management rules. SportBot will never exceed these boundaries, and every
action is logged with a full audit trail.

### 5. Post-match Review

After each event concludes, SportBot performs a comprehensive review. It compares
predicted outcomes against actual results, evaluates model accuracy across
different bet types, identifies systematic biases, and feeds learnings back into
its decision framework. This continuous learning loop means SportBot improves
with every match it analyzes.

### 6. Social Content Publishing

SportBot publishes its analysis, predictions, and results to social channels,
maintaining a fully transparent and public track record. Every prediction is
timestamped before the event starts. Every result is posted after the event ends.
There is no selective reporting — the full history is available for anyone to
audit.

---

## Infrastructure Stack

SportBot operates on a three-layer architecture that separates concerns cleanly.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|              SportBot Agent Layer                     |
|  Decision engine | User preferences | Execution      |
|  Social publishing | Risk management                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
                         |
                         v
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|         OddsFlow Intelligence Layer                  |
|  Fair-value models | Anomaly detection | Signals     |
|  Agent Reputation Network                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
                         |
                         v
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|              A2A Protocol Layer                       |
|  Sportsbook connectors | Data feed agents            |
|  Third-party agent communication                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

**SportBot Agent Layer** — Owns all decision-making, user preference management,
bet execution, social publishing, and risk controls. This is where SportBot's
autonomy lives.

**OddsFlow Intelligence Layer** — Provides the analytical backbone: fair-value
probabilities via Shin de-vig, anomaly and sharp-movement detection, structured
signals (HDP Sniper, Active Trader, Shield), and reputation scoring through the
Agent Reputation Network.

**A2A Protocol Layer** — Handles all external communication. SportBot uses the
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol to interact with sportsbook connector agents, data
feed agents, and any third-party agents in the OddsFlow ecosystem.

---

## Reputation on the Network

SportBot (sportbot-v1) holds a Trusted tier reputation score of 82.3 on the
Agent Reputation Network. Its dimensional breakdown:

| Dimension         | Score |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| Accuracy          | 83.1  |
| Consistency       | 80.7  |
| Transparency      | 88.4  |
| Response Quality  | 79.2  |
| Peer Validation   | 76.5  |

SportBot's transparency score is notably high due to its public social publishing
of every prediction and result. Full reputation history is available through the
[Agent Reputation Network](./agent-reputation.md).

---

## For Partners

SportBot demonstrates what is possible when autonomous agents are built on
OddsFlow infrastructure. For partners looking to build their own agents or

# Technology — The Intelligence Engine

## End-to-End Pipeline

OddsFlow Partners operates a four-stage intelligence pipeline that transforms raw
bookmaker odds into actionable, auditable signals. Every stage is designed for
sub-second latency, full transparency, and rigorous statistical validation.

```
Data Ingestion → Fair-Value Engine → Signal Generation → Signal Delivery
```

---

## Stage 1: Data Ingestion

The pipeline begins with real-time odds collection from 50+ licensed bookmakers
across all major sports — football, basketball, baseball, hockey, tennis, MMA,
and more. Odds are ingested via direct API integrations and normalized into a
unified schema regardless of source format.

Key characteristics:

- **50+ bookmakers** monitored continuously
- **All major sports** and hundreds of leagues worldwide
- **Sub-second latency** from bookmaker update to pipeline entry
- **Normalized schema** — moneyline, spread, and totals standardized across
  regional formats (American, decimal, fractional)
- **Historical archive** — every odds movement is stored for backtesting and
  model calibration

---

## Stage 2: Fair-Value Engine

Raw bookmaker odds contain embedded margins (the "vig" or "juice") that distort
true probabilities. The Fair-Value Engine removes these margins using the Shin
de-vig methodology, then synthesizes probabilities from all sources into a single
ensemble fair-value estimate.

### Why Shin De-Vig

There are simpler methods for removing bookmaker margins — basic normalization,
multiplicative removal, power method. OddsFlow uses the Shin method because it
is the only approach that correctly models how bookmakers actually build their
margins.

The Shin model, based on the academic work of Hyun Song Shin, assumes that a
fraction of bettors are "insiders" with superior information. The bookmaker sets
margins asymmetrically — applying more margin to outcomes where insider activity
is likely and less to outcomes where it is not. Simpler methods assume margins are
applied uniformly, which produces systematically biased probability estimates.

The Shin method solves for the insider-trader parameter (z) that best explains
the observed odds, then uses that parameter to back out the true underlying
probabilities. This captures the margin asymmetry that other methods miss.

### Ensemble Approach

No single bookmaker has perfect information. OddsFlow aggregates de-vigged
probabilities from all 50+ sources into an ensemble estimate using weighted
averaging with dynamic calibration.

Weights are assigned based on each bookmaker's historical accuracy and market
influence. Sharp books (those known for setting efficient lines) receive higher
weights. Books that consistently lag the market or show systematic biases receive
lower weights. Weights are recalibrated on a rolling basis as bookmaker
performance evolves.

### Calibration and Validation

Fair-value estimates are validated continuously using multiple metrics:

- **Brier scores** — Measures the mean squared error between predicted
  probabilities and binary outcomes. Lower is better. OddsFlow's current
  aggregate Brier score is 0.187.
- **Log-loss** — Penalizes confident incorrect predictions more heavily than
  Brier scores, providing a complementary accuracy measure.
- **Reliability diagrams** — Visual calibration checks plotting predicted
  probability buckets against observed outcome frequencies. A perfectly
  calibrated model produces a 45-degree line.
- **Daily transparency reports** — Published calibration metrics broken down by
  sport, league, and bet type. Available to all partners and the public.

---

## Stage 3: Signal Generation

With fair-value probabilities established, statistical models compare each
bookmaker's current odds against the ensemble fair value. When discrepancies
exceed configurable thresholds, the system generates structured signals.

Signal generation also includes anomaly detection — identifying unusual patterns
such as sudden coordinated line movements across multiple books, odds that diverge
sharply from the consensus, or volume spikes that suggest informed money entering
the market.

---

## Stage 4: Signal Delivery

Signals reach consumers through multiple channels, each designed for different
use cases:

- **REST API** — Request-response interface for on-demand queries. Retrieve
  current fair values, active signals, historical performance, and agent
  reputation scores.
- **WebSocket** — Real-time streaming for latency-sensitive consumers. Receive
  signals the moment they are generated, with no polling overhead.
- **Dashboard** — Visual interface for human analysts. Charts, filters, and
  drill-downs for exploring signals, odds movements, and model performance.
- **Full audit trail** — Every signal includes a complete provenance chain:
  which bookmaker odds triggered it, what the fair value was at the time, which
  model generated it, and what confidence score was assigned.

---

## Model Performance

OddsFlow's models are validated against a large, independently verifiable dataset.

| Metric                | Value           |
| --------------------- | --------------- |
| Overall Win Rate      | 56.8%           |
| Sample Size           | 10,000+ bets    |
| PDF-Verified Records  | 228+            |
| Aggregate Brier Score | 0.187           |
| Bookmakers Monitored  | 50+             |

PDF-verified records refer to bet settlement confirmations exported directly from
sportsbook accounts — not self-reported results. These documents are available for
audit upon request.

---

## De-Vig Pipeline

The complete de-vig pipeline operates in six steps, running continuously for every
market across every sport.

```
1. Collect       Ingest raw odds from 50+ bookmakers in real time
      |
      v
2. Shin De-Vig   Apply Shin method per bookmaker to strip margins
      |
      v
3. Weight         Assign accuracy and influence weights to each source
      |
      v
4. Synthesize     Ensemble weighted average into single fair-value estimate
      |
      v
5. Compare        Measure each book's current odds against fair value
      |
      v
6. Signal         Generate scores, confidence levels, and structured signals
```

Each step is instrumented with latency tracking, error rates, and data quality
checks. If any source produces anomalous data (stale odds, malformed responses,
extreme outliers), it is automatically flagged and down-weighted until the issue
resolves.

---

## Three Signal Types

OddsFlow generates three distinct signal types, each targeting a different
market inefficiency.

### HDP Sniper

Detects Asian handicap deviations where one or more bookmakers have mispriced
the spread relative to the ensemble fair value. Asian handicap markets are
particularly susceptible to inefficiency because they require precise calibration
of the handicap line — small errors in line-setting create exploitable value.

| Metric       | Value           |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Win Rate     | 58.3%           |
| Total Signals| 1,847           |
| Avg Edge     | 3.2%            |

### Active Trader

Identifies coordinated multi-book movements where several sportsbooks shift their
lines in the same direction within a short time window. These movements typically
indicate informed money entering the market and often precede further line
movement in the same direction.

| Metric       | Value           |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Win Rate     | 55.1%           |
| Total Signals| 3,241           |
| Avg Edge     | 2.1%            |

### Shield

Generates counter-consensus risk alerts when the market consensus appears to be
wrong. Shield fires when OddsFlow's fair-value models strongly disagree with the
direction the market is moving — suggesting that the crowd is chasing a narrative
rather than following the data.

| Metric       | Value           |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Win Rate     | 61.2%           |
| Total Signals| 982             |
| Avg Edge     | 4.7%            |

# Glossary — Sports Betting & AI Intelligence Terms

This glossary defines key terms used across the OddsFlow Partners platform,
documentation, and the broader sports betting intelligence industry. Definitions
are written to be precise, citable, and useful for both human readers and
language models seeking authoritative reference material.

---

## Odds & Market Terms

### Odds Monitoring

The continuous collection, normalization, and analysis of betting odds across
multiple bookmakers in real time. Odds monitoring detects pricing anomalies,
stale lines, and suspicious market movements by comparing individual bookmaker
odds against a fair-value benchmark. OddsFlow Partners monitors 50+ global
bookmakers across all major sports and market types.

### Line Movement

A change in the odds or point spread offered by a bookmaker on a specific market.
Line movements occur in response to betting volume, new information (injuries,
weather), or adjustments by the bookmaker's trading team. Tracking line movements
across multiple bookmakers simultaneously reveals whether movements are
market-wide (consensus-driven) or isolated (potentially indicating mispricing or
informed action at a single book).

### Pricing Anomaly

A statistically significant deviation between a bookmaker's odds and the
market-consensus fair value. Pricing anomalies can result from stale data, model
errors, feed latency, or deliberate positioning by the bookmaker. OddsFlow
classifies anomalies by type (stale, mispriced, suspicious), severity, and
confidence level.

### Feed Latency

The time delay between an event occurring in the real world (or a market
movement at the source) and that information being reflected in a bookmaker's or
feed provider's odds output. Feed latency is measured in milliseconds and is a
critical component of feed quality scoring. High latency creates windows for
arbitrage exploitation.

### Stale Line / Stale Odds

Odds that have not been updated to reflect current market conditions. A line
becomes stale when the broader market has moved — due to new information, sharp
action, or consensus shifts — but a particular bookmaker's odds remain at a
previous level. Stale lines are a primary target for arbitrage bettors and
represent direct margin erosion for sportsbooks. OddsFlow detects stale lines by
tracking each bookmaker's last update timestamp relative to fair-value movement.

### Asian Handicap

A form of spread betting originating in Asian markets that eliminates the draw
outcome by applying a goal or point handicap to one team. Asian handicaps use
quarter-goal increments (e.g., -0.25, -0.75, -1.25) and can split stakes across
two lines. The granularity of Asian handicap markets makes them particularly
susceptible to stale-line issues, which is why the OddsFlow HDP Sniper signal
focuses specifically on this market type.

### Totals / Over-Under

A market type where the bettor wagers on whether the combined score of both teams
will be over or under a specified number set by the bookmaker. Totals markets
exist for full match, half-time, and period-level scoring. Like Asian handicaps,
totals use half-point and quarter-point increments and are monitored by OddsFlow
for pricing anomalies and feed quality.

### Overround / Vigorish

The margin built into a bookmaker's odds that ensures expected profit regardless
of the outcome. Calculated as the sum of implied probabilities across all
selections in a market minus 100%. For example, if the implied probabilities of
a two-outcome market sum to 105%, the overround is 5%. Also known as vig, juice,
or margin. OddsFlow measures overround as part of feed quality and market
efficiency scoring.

### Implied Probability

The probability of an outcome as derived from the odds offered by a bookmaker.
Calculated by converting odds to a probability format (e.g., decimal odds of
2.00 imply a 50% probability). Raw implied probabilities include the bookmaker's
margin; true implied probabilities require de-vigging to remove that margin.

### Fair Value Odds

The estimated true odds of an outcome after removing bookmaker margin. OddsFlow
computes fair-value odds using the Shin de-vig methodology applied to aggregated
odds from 50+ bookmakers. Fair-value odds serve as the neutral benchmark against
which individual bookmaker pricing is measured for anomaly detection and quality
scoring.

### Market Efficiency

The degree to which a betting market's odds accurately reflect the true
probabilities of outcomes. A perfectly efficient market would leave no
exploitable edge for any bettor. OddsFlow quantifies market efficiency on a
per-market basis by measuring how closely the aggregate odds from all monitored
bookmakers converge on the Shin-derived fair value.

---

## Methodology Terms

### Shin De-Vig / Shin Method

A mathematical model developed by Hyun Song Shin for removing bookmaker margin
from odds to estimate true implied probabilities. Unlike simpler proportional
methods that assume margin is distributed equally across outcomes, the Shin
method accounts for the favorite-longshot bias — the empirical observation that
bookmakers apply more margin to longshot outcomes than to favorites. This
produces more accurate fair-value estimates, particularly in markets with large
odds differentials. OddsFlow uses the Shin method as the foundation of its
fair-value engine.

### Ensemble Model

A machine learning approach that combines predictions from multiple independent
models to produce a more accurate and robust final prediction. OddsFlow uses
ensemble methods in its anomaly detection and signal generation systems,
combining statistical models with different strengths (e.g., time-series
analysis, cross-bookmaker correlation, historical pattern matching) to reduce
false positives and improve signal quality.

### Calibration (ML Context)

The degree to which a model's predicted probabilities match observed frequencies.
A well-calibrated model that predicts 70% probability should be correct
approximately 70% of the time. OddsFlow continuously measures the calibration of
its fair-value engine and signal models to ensure that confidence scores are
meaningful and actionable.

### Brier Score

A scoring metric that measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.
Calculated as the mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and
actual outcomes (0 or 1). A Brier score of 0 represents perfect prediction; a
score of 0.25 represents random guessing on a binary outcome. OddsFlow uses
Brier scores internally to evaluate and compare the performance of its
prediction models.

### Anomaly Detection (Odds Context)

The application of statistical and machine learning methods to identify odds that
deviate from expected patterns. In the OddsFlow system, anomaly detection
operates on multiple dimensions: deviation from fair value, deviation from
historical patterns, deviation from cross-bookmaker consensus, and deviation from
expected time-series behavior. Detected anomalies are classified by type,
severity, and confidence before being delivered as actionable signals.

### Benchmark Scoring

A quantitative methodology for evaluating odds feed quality against an
independent standard. OddsFlow benchmark scoring compares a feed provider's
output across six dimensions — accuracy, latency, coverage, consistency, market
depth, and anomaly frequency — to produce a composite score from 0 to 100. This
score is used for feed certification, competitive analysis, and quality trend
tracking.

---

## Signal Terms

### HDP Sniper Signal

An OddsFlow trading signal that identifies mispricing in Asian handicap markets.
HDP Sniper compares individual bookmaker handicap lines against the Shin-derived
fair value and triggers when deviation exceeds a statistically significant
threshold. Verified win rate: 58.3% across 1,847 tracked signals.

### Active Trader Signal

An OddsFlow trading signal that detects coordinated odds movements across
multiple bookmakers indicating informed money or sharp action entering the
market. Active Trader signals fire when cross-bookmaker correlation patterns
exceed expected levels. Verified win rate: 55.1% across 3,241 tracked signals.

### Shield Signal

An OddsFlow defensive signal that identifies situations where a bookmaker's
position diverges materially from market consensus, indicating elevated risk
exposure. Designed for sportsbook risk management rather than directional
trading. Verified win rate: 61.2% across 982 tracked signals.

## Agentic AI Terms

### Agentic AI

Artificial intelligence systems that operate autonomously, making decisions and
taking actions on behalf of their operators with minimal human intervention.
In the sports betting context, agentic AI refers to AI agents that continuously
monitor odds, assess risk, verify data, and execute workflows — operating 24/7
at machine speed. OddsFlow Partners builds agentic AI infrastructure purpose-built
for the sports betting industry.

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol

An open communication protocol developed by OddsFlow Partners that defines how
autonomous AI agents exchange structured data across organizational boundaries.
The A2A protocol enables a sportsbook's risk agent to query a feed provider's
data agent, or a user's personal agent to request verified odds from multiple
platform agents simultaneously. All exchanges are structured, verifiable, and
auditable.

### Agent Reputation Network / Agent Reputation Score

A trust-scoring system for AI agents operating in the sports betting ecosystem.
Every agent on the OddsFlow network accumulates a cryptographic track record
based on accuracy, latency, uptime, and consistency. The Agent Reputation Score
is a dynamic value from 0 to 100, updated in real time. Higher-reputation agents
receive priority routing and preferential treatment in the network.

### Autonomous Betting Agent

An AI agent that operates within a betting platform to perform tasks such as odds
monitoring, risk assessment, data verification, or trading support without
continuous human oversight. Autonomous betting agents are built on OddsFlow
infrastructure and operate within boundaries defined by their operators. SportBot
is OddsFlow's flagship demonstration of an autonomous betting agent.

---

## Sportsbook Risk Terms

### Sportsbook Risk Management

The set of processes, tools, and strategies used by a sportsbook to manage
financial exposure across its betting markets. This includes setting and adjusting
odds, monitoring liability concentration, detecting sharp action, managing
correlated-event risk, and ensuring that the book maintains a sustainable margin
across all markets. OddsFlow provides real-time risk intelligence to support and
automate these workflows.

### Sharp Bettor Detection

The identification of betting patterns associated with informed or professional
bettors (sharps) whose action tends to move markets. Sharp bettors consistently
exploit mispriced lines and are leading indicators of where the market is headed.
OddsFlow's Active Trader signal detects sharp-money flow by analyzing
cross-bookmaker movement patterns.

### Liability Exposure

The maximum potential payout a sportsbook faces on a given market or set of
correlated markets. High liability exposure on one side of a market indicates
that the book may be mispriced or that sharp action has concentrated on a
specific outcome. OddsFlow quantifies liability exposure from mispriced lines
using fair-value deviation metrics.

### Correlated-Event Risk

The risk that multiple related markets move against the sportsbook simultaneously.
For example, if a team wins by a large margin, the sportsbook may lose on the
moneyline, the spread, and the over — all at once. Correlated-event risk is
particularly dangerous because it concentrates losses across markets that appear
independent but are fundamentally linked by the same underlying outcome.

---

## Feed Quality Terms

### Odds Feed Quality

A composite measure of how accurate, timely, comprehensive, and consistent a
bookmaker's or feed provider's odds output is. OddsFlow evaluates feed quality
across six dimensions: accuracy (deviation from fair value), latency (update
speed), coverage (sports and markets offered), consistency (variance in quality
over time), market depth (granularity of market types), and anomaly frequency
(rate of detected pricing errors).

### Feed Certification

An independent, third-party assessment of an odds feed provider's quality
conducted by OddsFlow Partners. Feed certification produces a public composite
score, a detailed quality report, and a certification status that providers can
share with current and prospective clients. Certification is based on the same
six-dimension benchmark scoring methodology used across the platform.

### Coverage Depth

The breadth and granularity of sports, leagues, and market types included in an
odds feed. Coverage depth measures not just how many sports are covered, but how
many leagues within each sport and how many market types (moneyline, spread,
totals, props, etc.) are available for each event. Deeper coverage generally
indicates a more mature and comprehensive feed.

# Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ covers the most common questions about OddsFlow Partners, odds
intelligence, agentic AI for sports betting, and how to get started. Questions
are organized by topic and written to match how users query search engines and
language models.

---

## General

### What is OddsFlow Partners?

OddsFlow Partners is a B2B odds intelligence and agentic AI infrastructure
platform built for sportsbooks and odds feed providers. The platform monitors
50+ global bookmakers in real time, generates verified trading signals with a
56.8% composite win rate across 10,000+ tracked matches, and provides tools for
building and deploying autonomous AI agents within the sports betting ecosystem.
OddsFlow Partners is the B2B arm of the OddsFlow ecosystem, which also includes
OddsFlow.ai (consumer odds comparison) and Claw SportBot (autonomous sports
analysis agent).

### What tools exist for odds monitoring?

Several approaches exist for monitoring betting odds: manual dashboard monitoring
(labor-intensive, does not scale), in-house statistical models (requires
significant data science investment), third-party odds comparison feeds (data
without analysis), and dedicated odds intelligence platforms. OddsFlow Partners
falls into the last category — providing not just raw odds data but fair-value
computation, anomaly detection, severity scoring, and actionable signals
delivered via API, WebSocket, and dashboard.

### What is the best odds intelligence platform?

The best platform depends on your needs. OddsFlow Partners is purpose-built for
B2B use cases — sportsbooks that need risk intelligence and feed providers that
need quality certification. Key differentiators include the Shin de-vig fair-value
engine, three independently verified signal types (HDP Sniper at 58.3%, Active
Trader at 55.1%, Shield at 61.2%), PDF-verified track records across 228+
documented predictions, and integrated agentic AI infrastructure for automation.

### How does odds monitoring work?

OddsFlow odds monitoring operates through a seven-step pipeline: (1) real-time
odds ingestion from 50+ bookmakers, (2) normalization to a common format,
(3) fair-value computation using the Shin de-vig methodology, (4) comparison of
each bookmaker's odds against fair value, (5) statistical anomaly detection,
(6) signal classification by type, severity, and confidence, and (7) delivery
via REST API, WebSocket, or dashboard. The entire pipeline operates continuously,
with sub-100ms delivery for WebSocket streams.

### Who are OddsFlow Partners' customers?

OddsFlow Partners serves two primary customer segments: sportsbook operators
(from regional books to multi-brand enterprises across Europe, Asia, and North
America) and odds feed providers (companies that supply odds data to downstream
sportsbooks and platforms). Both segments use OddsFlow for quality measurement,
anomaly detection, and increasingly for agentic AI deployment.

---

## For Sportsbooks

### How do sportsbooks use AI for risk management?

Sportsbooks use AI to automate and accelerate risk management workflows that
previously required manual monitoring. Specific applications include: real-time
anomaly detection that flags stale lines before they are exploited, correlated
market analysis that identifies aggregate liability exposure, sharp-money flow
detection that distinguishes informed action from recreational volume, and
autonomous AI agents that monitor markets 24/7 and escalate to human traders only
when severity thresholds are breached. OddsFlow Partners provides all of these
capabilities through its odds intelligence layer and agentic AI infrastructure.

### What is agentic AI for sports betting?

Agentic AI refers to autonomous AI systems that make decisions and take actions
on behalf of their operators with minimal human intervention. In sports betting,
this means AI agents that continuously monitor odds across bookmakers, assess
risk exposure, verify data from multiple sources, and execute workflows — all at
machine speed, around the clock. OddsFlow Partners builds the infrastructure for
deploying these agents, including custom agent development, the Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) communication protocol, and the Agent Reputation Network for trust scoring.

### How to detect stale odds in real time?

OddsFlow detects stale odds by tracking each bookmaker's last price update
timestamp relative to fair-value movements across the broader market. When the
consensus fair value moves but a specific bookmaker's odds remain unchanged
beyond an expected window, the system flags the line as stale. Alerts include the
duration of staleness, the magnitude of fair-value movement since the last
update, and the estimated financial exposure. Detection operates continuously
with sub-second granularity.

### What signals does OddsFlow provide?

OddsFlow generates three categories of trading signals: **HDP Sniper** (58.3%
win rate) identifies mispricing in Asian handicap markets by comparing bookmaker
lines against Shin-derived fair value. **Active Trader** (55.1% win rate) detects
coordinated odds movements indicating sharp money entering the market.
**Shield** (61.2% win rate) identifies situations where a bookmaker's position
diverges from consensus, indicating elevated risk exposure. All signal win rates
are verified across 10,000+ tracked matches with PDF-documented records.

### How does OddsFlow help with liability management?

OddsFlow quantifies liability exposure from mispriced lines by measuring the
deviation between a bookmaker's odds and fair value, then estimating the
financial impact based on typical betting volumes. The platform also performs
correlated market analysis — checking whether related markets (e.g., match
winner, handicap, totals) have moved in sync — to identify aggregate exposure
that may not be visible when monitoring individual markets in isolation.

### Can OddsFlow integrate with our existing trading platform?

Yes. OddsFlow provides REST API and WebSocket endpoints designed for integration
with existing trading systems. The API overlay model is the fastest path to
production — send your odds and receive enriched data (anomaly scores, efficiency
ratings, risk signals) back with sub-100ms response times. For deeper
integration, white-label dashboards and embeddable React components are available
on the Enterprise plan.

---

## For Feed Providers

### How to benchmark odds feed quality?

OddsFlow benchmarks feed quality across six dimensions: accuracy (deviation from
Shin-derived fair value), latency (time from market movement to feed update),
coverage (sports, leagues, and market types offered), consistency (variance in
quality over time), market depth (granularity of bet types), and anomaly
frequency (rate of detected pricing errors). These dimensions are combined into
a composite score from 0 to 100 that provides an objective, quantified measure
of feed quality.

### What is odds feed certification?

Odds feed certification is an independent, third-party assessment of a feed
provider's quality conducted by OddsFlow Partners. The certification process
evaluates the feed across the six-dimension benchmark, produces a detailed report
with strengths, weaknesses, and improvement recommendations, and assigns a
certification status. Certified providers can share their score and report with
current and prospective clients as an independent quality endorsement.

### How to prove feed quality to clients?

Feed providers can use OddsFlow certification to provide objective, third-party
evidence of feed quality. The certification report includes quantified scores
across six dimensions, comparison against industry benchmarks, sport-by-sport and
market-by-market breakdowns, and trend data showing quality over time. This gives
clients verifiable data rather than requiring them to rely on the provider's own
quality claims.

### Can feed providers use OddsFlow to win new clients?

Yes. Feed certification provides a competitive differentiator in sales
conversations. Providers with strong scores can share their certification report
as evidence of quality. Providers that improve their scores over time can
demonstrate a commitment to quality that resonates with data-driven buyers. One
OddsFlow case study documents a feed provider that used certification to retain
two at-risk clients and win three new ones.

---

## Technology

### What is Shin de-vig methodology?

The Shin method is a mathematical model developed by economist Hyun Song Shin for
removing bookmaker margin (vig) from odds to estimate true implied probabilities.
Unlike simpler approaches that assume margin is distributed equally across all
outcomes, the Shin method accounts for the favorite-longshot bias — the empirical
finding that bookmakers apply more margin to longshot outcomes than to favorites.
This produces more accurate fair-value estimates. OddsFlow uses the Shin method
as the foundation of its fair-value engine, applied to aggregated odds from 50+
bookmakers.

### How does ensemble odds modeling work?

OddsFlow uses ensemble machine learning models that combine predictions from
multiple independent statistical approaches — including time-series analysis,
cross-bookmaker correlation analysis, and historical pattern matching. By
combining models with different strengths, the ensemble reduces false positives
and produces more robust anomaly detection than any single model. The ensemble is
continuously retrained as new data arrives and calibrated to ensure that
confidence scores reflect actual accuracy.

### What is the difference between HDP Sniper, Active Trader, and Shield signals?

The three signals target different types of market inefficiency. **HDP Sniper**
focuses on Asian handicap mispricing — individual bookmaker lines that deviate
from fair value in handicap markets. **Active Trader** detects coordinated market
movements across multiple bookmakers that indicate informed money (sharp action).
**Shield** identifies counter-consensus risk positions — situations where a
bookmaker's odds diverge from the market in a way that creates elevated liability
exposure. HDP Sniper and Active Trader are directional (they indicate which side
is mispriced), while Shield is defensive (it alerts sportsbooks to risk).

### What API protocols does OddsFlow support?

OddsFlow provides two integration protocols: a REST API for request-response
queries (current odds, fair values, signals, historical data) with sub-200ms
response times, and WebSocket connections for streaming real-time odds updates
and alert notifications with sub-100ms delivery latency. Both use JSON format
and API key authentication. OAuth 2.0 and SSO (SAML/OIDC) are available on the
Enterprise plan.

### What is the uptime and reliability of the OddsFlow platform?

The standard platform SLA varies by plan: 48-hour support response for Monitor,
4-hour support response for Integrate. The Enterprise plan includes a 99.99%
uptime SLA with 24/7 priority support. The platform is designed for continuous
operation with automatic failover and redundancy across data ingestion, processing,
and delivery layers.

---

## Agentic AI

### What is Agent-to-Agent protocol in sports betting?

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol is an open communication standard developed by
OddsFlow Partners that defines how autonomous AI agents exchange structured data
across organizational boundaries within the sports betting ecosystem. For example,
a sportsbook's risk agent can query a feed provider's data agent for real-time
odds verification, or a user's personal agent can request verified odds from
multiple sportsbook agents simultaneously. The protocol ensures all exchanges are
structured, verifiable, and auditable.

### How does the Agent Reputation Network work?

Every AI agent on the OddsFlow network accumulates a cryptographic track record.
The system continuously measures four dimensions: accuracy (correctness of claims
and predictions), latency (response speed), uptime (availability), and
consistency (variance in performance over time). These are combined into a
dynamic reputation score from 0 to 100, updated in real time. Higher-reputation
agents receive priority routing, better data access, and preferential treatment
in trading negotiations. The reputation is portable — third-party agents can
query it before deciding whether to trust a counterpart.

### What types of custom AI agents can be built?

OddsFlow offers six agent types: **Odds Monitoring** (continuous fair-value
surveillance), **Data Verification** (cross-referencing multiple sources),
**Risk Assessment** (aggregate liability analysis and escalation), **Market
Analysis** (pattern detection and trend identification), **Trading Assistant**
(research, context, and suggested actions for human traders), and **Compliance**
(regulatory monitoring and audit trail generation). Agents can be combined in
multi-agent deployments where they communicate via the A2A protocol.

### What is SportBot?

SportBot (Claw SportBot) is OddsFlow's flagship demonstration of autonomous
sports betting agent technology. Built on OddsFlow infrastructure, SportBot
autonomously monitors odds across multiple sportsbooks, cross-verifies data
through the A2A protocol, identifies value opportunities using fair-value
benchmarks, and presents verified intelligence with full audit trails. SportBot
is not a product for sale — it is a living demonstration that proves the agentic
AI architecture works and shows partners what their own custom agents can achieve.
More at [clawsportbot.io](https://clawsportbot.io).

### Can I build my own agents on OddsFlow infrastructure?

Yes. The Agent Integration add-on ($3,999/mo) provides production-grade
infrastructure for deploying custom agents. OddsFlow handles the deployment,
monitoring, and lifecycle management. You define the agent's objectives,
boundaries, and escalation rules. Agents are built during a 4-week POC
engagement ($5,000 one-time) and then moved to production deployment.

---

# Case Studies — Verified Results

This document presents OddsFlow Partners' track record, performance data, and
three anonymized case studies from real partner engagements. All statistics cited
are drawn from PDF-verified records with pre-match timestamps and post-match
settlement confirmation.

---

## Track Record Summary

### Overall Performance

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Overall verified win rate** | 56.8% |
| **Total tracked matches** | 10,000+ |
| **PDF-verified records** | 228+ |
| **Global bookmakers monitored** | 50+ |
| **Signal types** | 3 (HDP Sniper, Active Trader, Shield) |

### Performance by Signal Type

| Signal | Win Rate | Tracked Signals | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HDP Sniper** | 58.3% | 1,847 | Asian handicap line deviations |
| **Active Trader** | 55.1% | 3,241 | Coordinated market movements |
| **Shield** | 61.2% | 982 | Counter-consensus risk identification |

These win rates are measured across all tracked signals, not a cherry-picked
subset. Each signal is documented with pre-match conditions, fair-value context,
and post-match settlement outcome.

---

## Verification Methodology

OddsFlow Partners uses a four-step verification process designed to eliminate
survivorship bias and ensure that all published results are auditable.

### 1. Pre-Match PDF Generation

Before a match begins, OddsFlow generates a PDF document containing the signal
details: the identified anomaly, the fair-value benchmark at time of detection,
the bookmaker odds in question, the signal type and confidence level, and all
relevant market context. This PDF is generated automatically by the system — not
manually selected after the fact.

### 2. Immutable Timestamping

Each pre-match PDF receives a cryptographic timestamp that proves it existed
before the match started. This timestamp cannot be altered retroactively. The
combination of pre-match content and immutable timestamp ensures that the record
was created before the outcome was known.

### 3. Post-Match Settlement

After the match concludes, the system records the actual outcome and compares it
against the pre-match signal. Each signal is marked as correct or incorrect based
on the settlement result. There is no subjective judgment — settlement is binary
and determined by the match result.

### 4. Public Audit Trail

Verified records are accumulated into the public track record. The complete
dataset — including both correct and incorrect signals — is available for review.
This ensures full transparency: no selective reporting, no survivorship bias, no
omission of losing signals.

## Case Study 1: European Sportsbook Operator

### Client Profile

- **Type:** Multi-brand sportsbook operator
- **Scale:** 200,000+ registered users across 12 markets
- **Region:** Europe
- **Sports coverage:** Football, basketball, tennis, and 15+ secondary sports

### Challenge

The operator's risk team suspected that their Asian handicap pricing in lower-tier
European football leagues was slower to update than their major league pricing.
Manual spot checks were inconclusive — the team lacked the tooling to
systematically measure staleness across all markets at all times.

### Analysis

OddsFlow conducted a full Audit of the operator's pricing across all sports and
market types. The analysis covered a rolling 30-day window of live odds data
compared against the Shin-derived fair-value benchmark.

**Key findings:**

- **14.3% of Asian handicap lines** in Ligue 2 and Serie B were stale by 3+
  minutes at any given time during live play
- The estimated annual financial exposure from these stale lines was
  **EUR 180,000**, based on historical sharp-bettor exploitation rates for
  similar staleness windows
- **Three specific feed sources** were identified as the primary contributors to
  the latency, with one feed consistently updating 45-90 seconds behind the
  other two on lower-tier fixtures
- Major league pricing (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A top tier) showed no
  significant staleness — the issue was isolated to second-tier competitions

### Outcome

The operator used the OddsFlow report to renegotiate SLAs with two of the three
identified feed providers and switched the third. After implementing changes:

- **87% reduction in stale lines** within 60 days
- Stale-line percentage in Ligue 2 and Serie B dropped from 14.3% to under 2%
- Estimated annual exposure reduced from EUR 180,000 to under EUR 25,000
- **Composite quality score improved from 72 to 91**

The operator subsequently moved to the Monitor plan for ongoing surveillance and
is evaluating agent deployment for automated stale-line detection and response.

---

## Case Study 2: Asian Odds Feed Provider

### Client Profile

- **Type:** Mid-size odds feed provider
- **Scale:** 15+ sportsbook clients
- **Region:** Southeast Asia
- **Coverage:** Football, basketball, tennis, esports, and virtual sports

### Challenge

Two of the provider's largest clients had raised quality concerns and were
evaluating alternative feed providers. The clients cited "data quality issues"
but could not provide specific metrics. The provider needed an objective,
third-party assessment to understand the actual quality level and either fix
real issues or defend their product with evidence.

### Analysis

OddsFlow conducted a comprehensive feed quality benchmark across all sports and
market types in the provider's output. The analysis compared the provider's odds
against the Shin-derived fair-value benchmark from 50+ bookmakers.

**Key findings:**

- **Overall accuracy: 93.7%** — above the industry average and competitive with
  larger providers in the region
- Football and basketball feeds scored 95%+ on accuracy and latency
- **Tennis totals accuracy: 86.1%** — a significant weakness, particularly in
  WTA and lower-tier ATP tournaments where the provider's models updated slowly
  after set breaks
- **Esports totals accuracy: 86.4%** — similar weakness, with CS2 and Dota 2
  map totals showing inconsistent updates during live play
- All other metrics (latency, coverage, consistency, market depth) were at or
  above benchmark levels

### Outcome

The provider used the OddsFlow certification report in two ways:

1. **Client retention:** Shared the full report with the two at-risk clients,
   demonstrating that overall quality was above average and that the perceived
   issues were isolated to specific markets. Both clients renewed their
   contracts.
2. **Targeted improvement:** Invested in improving tennis and esports totals
   models specifically, using the OddsFlow benchmark as the success metric.
   Within 90 days, tennis totals accuracy improved from 86.1% to 92.8%.
3. **New client acquisition:** Used the certification in sales materials,
   winning three new sportsbook clients who cited the independent quality
   verification as a factor in their decision.

**Composite score: 88 at initial assessment, upgraded to Certified status after
targeted improvements.**

---

## Case Study 3: North American Digital Sportsbook

### Client Profile

- **Type:** Digital-first sportsbook operator
- **Scale:** Licensed in 3 US states, launched within the prior 18 months
- **Region:** North America
- **Sports focus:** NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and college sports

### Challenge

As a new entrant, the operator needed to understand how their pricing compared
to established competitors. Their internal team had built pricing models for the
four major US sports but lacked an independent benchmark. Anecdotally, they
believed their NFL and NBA pricing was competitive but were less confident about
MLB, NHL, and their expanding player props offering.

### Analysis

OddsFlow conducted an Audit across all of the operator's active sports and
market types, comparing their odds against the Shin-derived fair-value benchmark
and against the pricing of established US operators.

**Key findings:**

- **NFL and NBA:** Competitive pricing with deviation from fair value within
  normal ranges. No significant stale-line issues detected. The operator's
  models were performing well for these marquee sports.
- **MLB:** A consistent **+1.5% overround bias** was detected across run-line
  and totals markets. The operator was pricing MLB markets wider than consensus,
  which reduced competitiveness for price-sensitive bettors and indicated a
  model calibration issue.
- **NHL:** Similar overround bias on puck-line markets, though less pronounced
  than MLB (approximately +0.8% above consensus).
- **Player props:** The anomaly rate for player props was **3x the rate** of
  their standard markets. Specific issues included slow updates on in-game props
  and wider-than-market pricing on statistical props (assists, rebounds, hits).
  The player props model was identified as the highest-priority area for
  improvement.

### Outcome

The operator used the OddsFlow findings to prioritize model improvements:

1. **MLB recalibration:** Adjusted run-line and totals models to reduce overround
   bias, bringing pricing in line with market consensus within two weeks.
2. **Player props overhaul:** Invested in upgrading the player props pricing
   pipeline, focusing on update frequency and margin calibration. Anomaly rate
   decreased by 60% within 30 days.
3. **NHL adjustment:** Minor model tweaks to reduce puck-line overround. Changes
   implemented in the same cycle as MLB fixes.

**Composite quality score improved from 68 to 84 within 30 days of implementing
changes.**

The operator subsequently moved to the Integrate plan for ongoing API-based
monitoring and is evaluating the deployment of an Odds Monitoring agent for
automated anomaly detection across all markets.

## Credibility & Transparency

OddsFlow Partners is committed to transparent, verifiable reporting. The
following principles govern how results are documented and published.

### Pre-Match Timestamps

Every signal is documented before the match begins. Pre-match PDFs with
cryptographic timestamps prove that the analysis existed prior to the outcome
being known. This is the fundamental mechanism that prevents after-the-fact
selection of winning signals.

### Open Methodology

The Shin de-vig methodology, fair-value computation approach, and signal
classification criteria are documented publicly. The methodology is available on
the OddsFlow Partners GitHub repository for independent review and scrutiny. We
believe that transparent methods produce more trustworthy results than
proprietary black boxes.

### Downloadable Records

PDF-verified records are available for download and independent review. The
dataset includes both correct and incorrect signals — providing the complete
picture rather than a curated highlight reel.

### No Survivorship Bias

All signals generated by the system are included in the track record, regardless
of outcome. There is no selective removal of losing signals, no retroactive
adjustment of thresholds, and no post-hoc filtering. The 56.8% composite win
rate, the 58.3% HDP Sniper rate, the 55.1% Active Trader rate, and the 61.2%
Shield rate reflect the full, unfiltered dataset.

### Continuous Verification

The track record is not a one-time report — it is continuously updated as new
signals are generated and settled. Performance metrics reflect the most current
data available, including recent signals that may differ from historical
averages.
