## Plan Details

### Audit (Free)

A one-time quality assessment of your odds feed or pricing operation. The Audit
produces a composite score from 0 to 100 based on six dimensions: accuracy,
latency, coverage, consistency, market depth, and anomaly frequency. Results are
delivered as a PDF report with a sport-by-sport breakdown, actionable
recommendations, and a 30-minute walkthrough call with the OddsFlow team.

The Audit is designed to give sportsbooks and feed providers a clear, quantified
picture of where they stand — with no commitment required.

### Monitor ($499/mo)

Continuous monitoring for sportsbooks and feed providers that want ongoing
visibility into their odds quality. Includes everything in the Audit plus daily
score updates, anomaly detection alerts, weekly trend reports, and full dashboard
access. Alerts are delivered via email and Slack.

The Monitor plan covers up to 5 sports and 3 market types. Additional sports can
be added for $99/mo each. Support requests are handled within a 48-hour SLA.

### Integrate ($2,499/mo) — Most Popular

Full API access with real-time signal delivery for teams that need to act on odds
intelligence programmatically. Includes everything in Monitor plus REST and
WebSocket API access, all three real-time signal types (HDP Sniper, Active Trader,
Shield), sub-100ms response times, unlimited sports and market coverage, custom
anomaly thresholds, webhook delivery, and access to the Agent Reputation Network.

The Integrate plan is designed for trading desks and platform teams that want to
embed odds intelligence directly into their workflows. Includes quarterly business
reviews and a 4-hour support SLA.

### Enterprise (Custom)

For organizations that require dedicated infrastructure, custom models, or
white-label deployment. Includes everything in Integrate plus white-label
dashboards, custom model training on your data, on-premise or private cloud
deployment options, a dedicated account manager, 99.99% uptime SLA, SSO and
role-based access control, custom data retention policies, bespoke signal
development, and 24/7 priority support.

Enterprise pricing is determined based on scope, volume, and deployment
requirements. Contact the team to discuss your needs.

## Agent Services Add-Ons

Agent services can be added to any paid plan (Monitor, Integrate, or Enterprise).

### Agent POC — $5,000 one-time

A 4-week proof-of-concept engagement that delivers a working AI agent connected to
your environment. Includes discovery, agent design, integration, and parallel
testing against live data. The POC produces measurable results: anomalies detected,
estimated margin impact, and time-to-detection improvements.

### Agent Integration — $3,999/mo (Recommended)

Production-grade agent deployment with full lifecycle management. Includes a
deployed agent operating in your production environment, Agent-to-Agent (A2A)
protocol integration for multi-agent communication, access to the Agent Reputation
Network, continuous monitoring and model retraining, and dedicated engineering
support.

This is the recommended path for teams that have completed a POC and are ready to
move to production.

### Agent Enterprise — Custom

Multi-agent deployments for organizations that need several agents operating across
different functions — odds monitoring, risk assessment, trading assistance,
compliance, and data verification. Pricing is based on the number of agents,
complexity of inter-agent communication, and infrastructure requirements.
